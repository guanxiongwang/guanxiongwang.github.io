I am passionate about science capacity sharing and capacity development worldwide, particularly around computational, open-source research skills.

## Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Nigeria and Ghana (COESSING)

[COESSING](https://coessing.org) is a one-week program aimed at building ocean science capacity in West Africa. 
I've had the pleasure of being an instructor at COESSING since 2017, and a lead organizer since 2019. 
The program evolved from being entirely in person in Ghana, to being entirely online during the Covid-19 pandemic, to now being a hybrid online and in-person event, alternating between being hosted in Ghana and Nigeria.

The school started out using proprietary software for computational labs, and in 2018 I taught some Python for the first time. It was so popular that I converted the school entirely to Python, and Python computing is now one of the main aspects (and for many the main draw) of the program! Since 2019, I have built a team of 6 Python instructors, 3 of whom are former participants in the school who have become Python experts!

Being involved with COESSING has been one of the most meaningful activities of my career. This event is truly a capactiy _sharing_ event, where instructors and participants learn from one another. It was through teaching Python at COESSING when I became a true open science enthusiast. It quickly became clear how important it is that we consider the tools we use to do our science, to make sure that these tools are openly accessible and do not inadvertently create barriers to potential collaborators.



## Global Ocean Corps

I am a co-lead for [Global Ocean Corps](https://globaloceancorps.org) - a program with the goal of inspiring ocean science capacity development and capacity sharing initiatives worldwide. Global Ocean Corps is still in its infancy, and we are currently working to set up and fund more summer schools like COESSING in other parts of the world.

## OceanHackWeek

[OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.org) (OHW) is a one-week collaborative learning experience aimed at teaching and promoting best-practice ocean science computational workflows. I have been an organizer, a member of the Steering Council, and a mentor for OHW.
