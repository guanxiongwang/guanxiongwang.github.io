I love the process of doing science. But, the scientific process isn't perfect - yet. I believe that open science practices - including the public sharing of research code, data, and results - are the best ways to accelerate the pace of science, make our science more robust, and broaden participation in science.

## Enabling Open Science at NASA and Beyond

I currently work to support and enable open science through NASA's Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, working on [NASA's Open Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/) (OSSI). The OSSI is a copmrehensive program to support NASA science move toward a more open and inclusive culture. Within the OSSI, our team establishes policies to help guide researchers in doing their work more openly, implements cyberinfrastructure needed to enable open workflows, runs funding solicitations to support open science activities, and fosters community engagement via NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) (TOPS) initiative. TOPS is a 5-year initiative to accelerate the adoption of open science.

I work on a variety of activities, including:
- Running an open science funding solicitation
- Running a review panel for open science solicitations
- Developing introductory open science curriculum materials
- Teaching introductory open science topics at large, academic conferences and within NASA
- Leading the development and running of an open science competition
- Creating an open science recognition challenge through the US White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
- Invited keynote speaker and panelist on topics related to open science, including funding and cloud computing
- Running sessions at science conferences showcasing open science activities and discussing open science funding
- Engage with the research community at conferences and workshops
- Strategy discussions around enabling open science
- Host TOPS community forums


## Open Science Community Engagement

### Pangeo

Since February 2022, I have served as a member of the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) Steering Council. [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) is a community for big data geoscience, and works at the intersection of community, software, and infrastrcuture.

### Open Source Science

Since October 2023, I have been a Steering Council member for the NumFocus initiative [Open Source Science](https://opensource.science) (OSSci). OSSci is a community at the intersection of open source software and scientific research.
