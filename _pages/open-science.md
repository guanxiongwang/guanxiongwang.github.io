# My Open Science Journey

More info about my passion and experience for open science.

I currently work to support and enable open science through NASA's Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, working on NASA's Open Source Science Initiative and [Transform to Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) initiative.
