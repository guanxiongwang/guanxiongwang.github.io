## Air-Sea Fluxes

With colleagues during my postdoc at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Columbia University, I looked at the effect of spatial resolution on air-sea heat fluxes in global climate models. The paper is currently in prep, and I will add more details soon!

## Energy and Temperature Variance Budgets

During my PhD and Postdoc, I worked with a Fourier analysis technique to compute energy and temperature variance budgets in the ocean, using climate model data.
